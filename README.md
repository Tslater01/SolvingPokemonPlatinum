# Mathematically Solving Pokémon Platinum
A solved game is a game whose outcome (win, lose, or draw) can be correctly predicted from any position, assuming both players play perfectly. This concept is usually applied to abstract strategy games, especially games with complete information and no element of chance; solving such a game may use combinatorial game theory and/or computer assistance. This repository contains a list of inputs that will beat 100% of all Pokémon Platinum games. No RNG manipulation is involved, and no frame-perfect inputs are required. The sequence of inputs is static; it does not require any information from the game. This code intends to enable beating the game with no visuals/audio or "blind and deaf."

# Overview
Python Passion Project, solving a game with massive variability and chance. Pokémon Platinum, part of the fourth generation of Pokémon games, is renowned for its complexity and variability. Unlike traditional board games, it presents a myriad of choices, random encounters, and strategies. This project aims to mathematically solve Pokémon Platinum, creating a set of inputs that guarantee victory without any in-game feedback.

# More Info
The concept of playing and completing a game without the traditional senses was popularized by projects such as "Can you Beat Pokemon FireRed while Blind and Deaf?". This project takes that challenge to the next level by not only attempting to complete Pokémon Platinum without visual or auditory cues but by mathematically determining a sequence of inputs that guarantees success.

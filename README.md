# Mathematically Solving Pokémon Platinum
What is a Solved Game? A solved game is a game whose outcome (win, lose, or draw) can be correctly predicted from any position, assuming both players play perfectly. This concept is usually applied to abstract strategy games, especially games with complete information and no element of chance; solving such a game may use combinatorial game theory and/or computer assistance. This repository contains a list of inputs that will beat 100% of all Pokémon Platinum games. No RNG manipulation is involved, and no frame-perfect inputs are required. The sequence of inputs is static; it does not require any information from the game. This list intends to enable beating the game with no visuals/audio or "blind and deaf."

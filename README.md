# Mathematically Solving Pokémon Platinum
This GitHub repository, "Mathematically Solving Pokémon Platinum," focuses on the concept of solving a game, where the outcome can be accurately predicted under perfect play conditions. Typically applied to abstract strategy games, this repository applies these principles to Pokémon Platinum, a game known for its complexity and variability.

Unlike traditional board games, Pokémon Platinum involves a multitude of choices, random encounters, and strategies. However, this project aims to overcome these challenges by providing a predetermined sequence of inputs that ensures victory, all without relying on in-game feedback, RNG manipulation, or frame-perfect inputs.

This Python Passion Project represents an ambitious attempt to mathematically solve Pokémon Platinum, aiming to create a foolproof set of inputs that guarantee success, regardless of the game's inherent variability. This project extends the concept of playing a game without traditional senses by going beyond the visual and auditory aspects, instead relying solely on mathematical calculations to secure victory. Additionally, progress updates are provided, with Gym 1 and Gym 2 already completed as of specific dates. This project's unique approach takes inspiration from endeavors like "Can you Beat Pokemon FireRed while Blind and Deaf?" but elevates the challenge by introducing mathematical precision to ensure success.
